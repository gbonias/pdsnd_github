### Date created
The US Bikeshare Data project was created in March 2022

### Project Title
US Bikeshare Data

### Description
This was a project that analysed data related to bike share systems for three US cities (Chicago, New York City and Washington) and answered questions regarding the profile of users and their bike sharing activity

### Files used
The source data were three .csv files (chicago.csv, new_york_city.csv, washington.csv) that included tables with user and bike rental data. The data were provided by Motivate, a bike share system provider for many major cities in the United States

### Credits
The support provided by the Udacity website were very helpful (Project specification page and FAQs page). As with any code I have ever written, stackoverflow was a website that I visited looking for answers to Python related questions
